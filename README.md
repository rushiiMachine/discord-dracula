cute dracula theme for discord~

partially restores the old layout prior to the *visual refresh*

## ♡ installation

Add the following snippet to the top of your custom css:

```css
@import url("https://dracula.rushii.dev/main.css");
```

Alternatively, you can download the [`dracula.theme.css`] theme file to add to your
